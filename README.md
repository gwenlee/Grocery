Subject: Need Your Help on Some Data Stuff â€“ Quick Turnaround?

Hey Gwen,

Hope youâ€™re doing well! I wanted to reach out to get your help on something. So, I was looking at our grocery sales for 2018 and, to be honest, things seem a bit all over the place. Iâ€™ve got this gut feeling that weâ€™re missing some big insights, but I canâ€™t quite put my finger on it.

Could you dive into the numbers and pull out some key findings for us? Iâ€™m particularly interested in a few things, though feel free to run wild with it:

Any idea how the sales trends changed over the months? Like, are there specific months that just tanked or did unexpectedly well? We need to know why that happened. Also, Iâ€™d love to understand if there are patterns in the types of products that sold better. Are there any hidden top-sellers that we didnâ€™t notice? What about customer behavior â€“ are there times of the year where people are spending more (or less)?

And honestly, if thereâ€™s anything that stands out that I havenâ€™t mentioned, throw it in! I'm sure there's stuff in the data that could help us improve our stock or even marketing.
Iâ€™m just throwing ideas out there â€“ youâ€™re the numbers person, so I trust your instincts. Can you take a look and get me some insights that I can share with the team? No rush, but also kinda need it soon-ish, you know how it goes ðŸ˜…. Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks a ton!
Sam
